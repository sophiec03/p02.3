"""
Problem:

    The function 'isCap' takes a string, and an integer, n.  

     * If the nth character (starting with the first as character 0) in the 
       string is a capital, it should print "Capital".
     
     * If it is not a capital, it should print "Non-capital".
      
     * If there is no such letter, because the string is too small, it should
       print "Too small"


Tests:

    >>> isCap("Test", 0)
    Capital
    >>> isCap("Test", 2)
    Non-capital
    >>> isCap("Another", 6)
    Non-capital
    >>> isCap("TEST", 3)
    Capital
    >>> isCap("", 2)
    Too small
    >>> isCap("Hooray", 6)
    Too small
