Problem:

    For part of a game, the players are allowed to use a calculator.
    We need to implement the part of the code that actually computes the
    answer when an expression is entered into the calculator.

    The function 'compute' takes 3 inputs: 2 numbers and an operator.
    The operator will be either "+", "-" or "x". In each case, the
    function should print the answer to the expression.

Tests:

    >>> compute(5, "+", 9)
    14
    >>> compute(7, "+", 12)
    19
    >>> compute(15, "-", 8)
    7
    >>> compute(12, "-", 20)
    -8
    >>> compute(4, "x", 5)
    20
    >>> compute(8, "x", 3)
    24
